      <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:17px;font-family: serif;">The young Prince, Maharana Jagat Singh requested his father, Maharana Sangram Singh II, if he could reside in the pleasure palace Jagmandir with his ladies. The Maharana did not give permission, but taunted his son that if he was so keen to stay in an Island Palace, why doesn't he build one for himself. It is this taunt that led to him building his own pleasure palace on Lake Pichola in the year 1743. The Maharana (ruler) called this palace which he finished building in 1746, Jag Niwas. Jag Niwas is today the majestic and magnificent Taj Lake Palace of Udaipur.  Restored to its pristine glory, this spectacular palace became world renowned when the James Bond film ‘Octopussy’ was filmed at it. It was the secluded lair of the film’s eponymous Bond Girl. This heritage hotel has 65 luxurious rooms and 18 grand suites. Its location on an island in the midst of a lake affords every room breathtaking views of the neighbouring City Palace, Aravalli Hills, Machla Magra Hills and Jag Mandir. The incomparable location provides the perfect backdrop for the  exquisite cuisines at the elegant restaurants of Taj Lake Palace. These are open only to resident guests. Signature speciality restaurants at this palace serves a choice of cuisines. Neel Kamal for authentic Rajasthani and other dishes from India; and the seasonally open-air Bhairo for contemporary European delicacies. In the evening, indulge in signature martinis, cocktails and a grand collection of premium international spirits at the bar, Amrit Sagar. Continue your being pampered as a royal at Jiva Spa, with a spa boat  experience like no other. Carefully created treatments draw on the ancient wellness heritage of India, and the fabled lifestyle and savoir vivre  of Indian royalty. This palace continues the tradition of grand soirees and formal levees which were hosted here by the royal family of Udaipur. Meetings and Incentives at Taj Lake Palace are like no where else in the world. Where else can you meet at a palace in the middle of a lake. And  this most romantic of hotels, is the ideal venue for fairytale weddings and magical honeymoons.  Known as the Venice of the East, the city of Udaipur, with its elaborate palaces, serene lakes, exotic temples and resplendent gardens, has a lot to offer. Our concierge would be happy to assist you in making arrangements, and plan a special tour of the city of lakes in one of our vintage cars.</p>
